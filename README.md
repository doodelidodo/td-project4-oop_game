# Treehouse Techdegree Project 4 - Phrase Hunter Game

The goal for this project was to learn OOP in javascript.

The game contains 5 phrases. If start is pressed, one is randomly selected and hidden on the playing field. Letters can be entered via onscreen keyboard or keyboard. If the letter appears in the sentence, it is revealed. If the letter does not occur, one life (5 in total) is deducted. If the sentence is completely solved, the player wins. If he loses all lives, the game is over and lost.
